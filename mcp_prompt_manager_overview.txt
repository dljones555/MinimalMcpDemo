1. Separation of Concerns and Extensibility
•	Server and client are cleanly separated: The server is responsible for prompt discovery and serving, while the client handles prompt selection and chat orchestration.
•	Extensible architecture: Both server and client are easy to extend (e.g., add prompt arguments, authentication, new LLM providers, or new prompt sources like HTTP/cloud).
---
2. Prompt Management via File System
•	Prompts as files: Using the file system for prompt management is simple, transparent, and version-control friendly.
•	Relative path naming: Prompts are named by their relative path, supporting logical grouping and easy navigation.
•	Auto-discovery: The server auto-discovers prompts, so adding/removing prompts is as easy as adding/removing files.
---
3. MCP Protocol as a Prompt API
•	Protocol abstraction: MCP provides a clean, language-agnostic API for prompt listing and retrieval, making it easy to swap out the backend or integrate with other tools.
•	Prompt content is not limited to static text: The protocol supports templates and function-backed prompts, enabling dynamic, parameterized, or computed prompt content.
---
4. Client Command Pattern
•	Command-driven UX: The client supports commands like /listprompts and /getprompt [name], making it easy to interactively browse and use prompts.
•	Prompt attachment (if implemented): The ability to attach a prompt to the chat context is powerful for LLM-driven workflows.
---
5. Async, Modern .NET Patterns
•	Async/await everywhere: All I/O is non-blocking, making the client and server scalable and responsive.
•	Modern HttpClient usage: Uses PostAsJsonAsync and ReadFromJsonAsync for clean, idiomatic HTTP calls.
---
6. Novel/Advanced Takeaways
•	Function-backed prompts: The MCP toolkit allows prompts to be implemented as code (functions), not just static files. This enables dynamic, context-aware, or API-driven prompt content.
•	Prompt arguments and templating: The protocol supports parameterized prompts, so you can build prompts that take user input or context variables.
•	DI and service injection: Function-backed prompts can leverage dependency injection, making them powerful for enterprise scenarios.
•	Multi-modal prompt content: The protocol supports not just text, but also images, audio, and more (via content blocks).
---
7. Developer Experience
•	Minimal ceremony: The prototype is easy to set up, run, and extend—ideal for rapid prototyping and experimentation.
•	Copilot/VS Code friendly: The code structure and patterns are easy for Copilot to understand and extend, reducing developer friction.
